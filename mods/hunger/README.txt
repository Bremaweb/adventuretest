Minetest mod "Hunger"
=====================
Version: 1.0

About this mod:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This mod adds hunger mechanics to Minetest, which are based on player actions and on time.
Also it changes the eating in Minetest, e.g. an Apple does not restore Health, but it rises your saturation.
Example: 1 apple fills up the hunger bar by 1 "bread" (statbar symbol).
Although the statbar show 20 hunger points (10 breads) on the HUD you can fill it up to 30 points.

By default it supports a lot of food already (see full list below) and food that for registered via the API.
For more information how to register more food see API.txt

Information:
This mod depends on the "Better HUD" mod (https://github.com/BlockMen/hud) to provide information about your current saturation.
