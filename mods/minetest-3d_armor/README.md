Modpack - 3d Armor [0.4.0]
==========================

[mod] Visible Player Armor [3d_armor]
-------------------------------------

depends: default, inventory_plus

Adds craftable armor that is visible to other players. Each armor item worn contributes to
a player's armor group level making them less vulnerable to weapons.

Armor takes damage when a player is hurt, however, many armor items offer a 'stackable'
percentage chance of restoring the lost health points. Overall armor level is boosted by 10%
when wearing a full matching set (helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots of the same material)

Compatible with player skins [skins] by Zeg9 and Player Textures [player_textures] by PilzAdam.

[mod] Visible Wielded Items [wieldview]
---------------------------------------

depends: 3d_armor

Makes hand wielded items visible to other players.

[mod] Shields [shields]
-------------------------------------

depends: 3d_armor

Originally a part of 3d_armor, shields have been re-included as an optional extra.
If you do not want shields then simply remove the shields folder from the modpack.
