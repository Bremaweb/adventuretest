Modmenu - Simple menu for mod actions
License: WTFPL
Requires Minetest 0.4.5 or later

This mod provides an in-game menu that can be used to access formspecs of other
mods which add buttons to it. The menu can be accessed by typing "/m" in the
in-game chat.

This modpack also includes a compatibility mod for inventory_plus (written from
scratch), which places mods that use inventory_plus.register_button() in the
menu as well. This should allow mods that previously used inventory_plus to work
with other mods that change the inventory (such as Unified Inventory).
If you want to use the original inventory_plus, remove the inventory_plus folder
from this modpack.
